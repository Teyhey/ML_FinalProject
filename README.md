# ML_FinalProject

## IMPORTANT
We went from Java code to Python code. The reason for this is because our Naive Bayes had a glaring issue, our accuracy for Naive Bayes was very low and just was not cutting it. We were getting an overall accuracy of 38%. We knew it was best to move on to improve the results of the project. So, we have the java code included, but we use the FinalProject.py to run the project and get our results.

## Don't run the Java code, it is incomplete. We moved over to Python, please use the FinalProject.py file!

## Report
All of our explanations and results with graphs are in the writeup included with our submission.
